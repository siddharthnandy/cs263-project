    "    \"Essays are scored based on the following properties:\\n\\nIdeas and Content:\\nDoes the writing sample fully accomplish the task (e.g., support an opinion, summarize, tell a story, or write an article)? Does it\\n-present a unifying theme or main idea without going off on tangents?\\n-stay completely focused on topic and task?\\nDoes the writing sample include thorough, relevant, and complete ideas? Does it\\n-include in-depth information and exceptional supporting details that are fully developed?\\n-fully explore many facets of the topic?\\n\\nOrganization:\\nAre the ideas in the writing sample organized logically? Does the writing\\n-present a meaningful, cohesive whole with a beginning, a middle, and an end (i.e., include an inviting introduction and a strong conclusion)?\\n-progress in an order that enhances meaning?\\n-include smooth transitions between ideas, sentences, and paragraphs to enhance meaning of text (i.e., have a clear connection of ideas and use topic sentences)?\\n\\nStyle:\\nDoes the writing sample exhibit exceptional word usage? Does it\\n-include vocabulary to make explanations detailed and precise, descriptions rich, and actions clear and vivid (e.g., varied word choices, action words, appropriate modifiers, sensory details)?\\n-demonstrate control of a challenging vocabulary?\\nDoes the writing sample demonstrate exceptional writing technique?\\n-Is the writing exceptionally fluent?\\n-Does it include varied sentence patterns, including complex sentences?\\n-Does it demonstrate use of writer's techniques (e.g., literary conventions such as imagery and dialogue and/or literary genres such as humor and suspense)?\\n\\nVoice:\\nDoes the writing sample demonstrate effective adjustment of language and tone to task and reader? Does it\\n-exhibit appropriate register (e.g., formal, personal, or dialect) to suit task?\\n-demonstrate a strong sense of audience?\\n-exhibit an original perspective (e.g., authoritative, lively, and/or exciting)?\\n\\nThe assignable scores are:\\n\\n6 points: A Score Point 6 paper is rare. It fully accomplishes the task in a thorough and insightful manner and has a distinctive quality that sets it apart as an outstanding performance.\\n5 points: A Score Point 5 paper represents a solid performance. It fully accomplishes the task, but lacks the overall level of sophistication and consistency of a Score Point 6 paper.\\n4 points: A Score Point 4 paper represents a good performance. It accomplishes the task, but generally needs to exhibit more development, better organization, or a more sophisticated writing style to receive a higher score.\\n3 points: A Score Point 3 paper represents a performance that minimally accomplishes the task. Some elements of development, organization, and writing style are weak.\\n2 points: A Score Point 2 paper represents a performance that only partially accomplishes the task. Some responses may exhibit difficulty maintaining a focus. Others may be too brief to provide sufficient development of the topic or evidence of adequate organizational or writing style.\\n1 point: A Score Point 1 paper represents a performance that fails to accomplish the task. It exhibits considerable difficulty in areas of development, organization, and writing style. The writing is generally either very brief or rambling and repetitive, sometimes resulting in a response that may be difficult to read or comprehend.\",\n",
